# logo-generator

## Description

This application takes user input and creates a basic logo in the form of a .svg file. 

It was built with Node.js, the 'inquirer' package, JavaScript, and a little HTML.

The user can enter the following information when designing their logo: 

- text (no more than 3 characters)
- text color (color keyword or hexadecimal number)
- shape (choose between triangle, square, or circle)
- shape color (color keyword or hexadecimal number)

Tests are included in this application, one for each of the three shapes.

Through making this logo generator, I:

- learned the value of having modular code
- became more familiar with how to connect modular code 
- have a better understanding of how to write tests
